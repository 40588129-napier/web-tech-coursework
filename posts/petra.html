                <h3>What is Petra?</h3>
                <p class="p2"> Petra is an ancient city that was built by the Nabatean civilisation. The city at one time had between 30 and 50 thousand residents and was active between 500BC and 500AD. The architecture of the city has been recognised to have been heavily influenced by Greek design but there are also elements that have been drawn from some of the other influences that the Nabateans would have been exposed to such as Roman and Syrian. </p>

                <h3>Tips on visiting</h3>
                <p class="p2"> Petra is located near the city of Ma'an, around 140 miles (3 hour drive) from the capital, Amman. There is plenty of accomodation to choose from near the site, such as the Marriott Petra Hotel. To get to the location from Queen Alia Airport, you could pay for a taxi which can cost up to 80JOD or rent a car which would allow you to explore other nearby attractions freely. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="p2"> In order to get the most out of Petra, it is recommended to spend two days, there is a lot more to see than the treasury (pictured). Two days admission is only 5JOD more than a day at 55JOD. Visiting in the morning will ensure a more pleasurable trip as it will be a bit cooler as well as quieter, allowing you to get better photos. Prepare yourself for a walk, you have over a 30 min walk through the canyon before reaching the first site, the entire trail is around 5 miles long.</p>
