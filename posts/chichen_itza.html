                <h3>What is Chichen Itza?</h3>
                <p class="p2"> Chichen Itza is the ruins of a Mayan city that was constructed around 600AD. Access to the sea enabled trade to be conducted from the site to wider regions and civilisations. The city was a pilgrimage site for the Mayan people, containing many cerominial buildings dedicated to various deities as well as The Sacred Cenote (Sacred Well), a water-filled sinkhole used for ceremonial sacrifice and offerings to the water god. The most well-known site of Chichen Itza, The Kulkulkan Pyramid wasn't actually constructed by the Mayans but rather the Toltecs who conquered the city in 1000AD, the Pyramid was named after the Toltec serpant god and is also known as El Castillo. </p>
